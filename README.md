# Minesweeper-game
This is a classic minesweeper game where you have to open cells in a minefield without getting hit by mines!
## Rules:
- field 16*16 cells, 40 min;
- on the left is a min counter from 40 to zero, on the right is a stopwatch;
- mines appear randomly;
- the first click should never be on a mine;
- if there are other fields with no mines nearby next to an open field, they open automatically;
- the right key puts a flag - this is how the place where the mine is supposed to be is marked;
- if you right-click on the checkbox, the question is raised, again - the selection is removed;
- clicking on the smiley restarts the game;
- frightened emoticon - the user has clicked on the field, but has not yet released the mouse button;
- after losing, the emoticon is replaced by a sad one, the user is shown a map of mines;
- after the user has opened all fields except mines, the emoticon puts on sunglasses, the stopwatch stops.
